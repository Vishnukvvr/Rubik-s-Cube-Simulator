# 🧩 Rubik's Cube Solver – React.js + Bootstrap

This project is a **Rubik's Cube Solver** implemented using **React.js** and **Bootstrap**. The core purpose is to demonstrate object-oriented programming, algorithmic problem solving, and cube manipulation logic — not necessarily a full-featured game or UI.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

The task was to develop an algorithm that can solve **any arbitrary Rubik’s Cube configuration** using these steps:

1. ✅ **Implement a basic object-oriented cube representation**
2. ✅ **Allow manual rotation of each face**
3. ✅ **Generate a scrambled Rubik’s Cube**
4. ✅ **Implement a solver algorithm** (not necessarily optimal)
5. ✅ **Display the steps taken and cube states at each step**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** (Frontend)
- **Bootstrap 5** (Styling)
- **JavaScript ES6+** (Logic & OOP)
- Optional: A mock `getCubeSvg()` method to simulate cube visuals.

## 🎯 Features

- 🎲 Object-oriented `Cube` class with all six faces (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`, `F`, `B`)
- 🔄 Manual face rotations (clockwise and counterclockwise)
- 🔀 Scramble generator
- 🧠 Beginner-level solve algorithm (reverse scramble)
- 📺 Visual display of all cube faces
- 💡 Designed to prioritize functionality over UI
